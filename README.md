# investigate-dataset-udacityproject
In this project, a comprehensive data analysis was carried out on a dataset (No-show appointments). The dataset contains information from 100k plus medical appointments in Brazil in 2016, which focused on whether patients show up for their appointment. A few characteristics (variables) about the patients are included in each row. I analyzed the dataset to see if one can predict whether patients will show up for their medical appointments and to also determine what factors or characteristics about patients influences the patients to show up or not show up for their appointments.
